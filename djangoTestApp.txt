Development Environment
	django authAdmin
		SU mikecranwill
		email mjcranwill@coe.edu
		pass p2nter1
	running inside virtualenv started with
		source venv/bin/activate
	deactivated with 
		deactivate
		
	localhost development is setup to run with
		foreman start
	which initializes all env variables and executes runserver at localhost:5000
	Database_Url is specified in .env file which is delimited in .gitignore
	
	for production, ProcFile must be changed to 
	web: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:$PORT --noreload
	
	for testing locally, db connection must be 'fixed' by hard coding last line
	in settings.py file.  This is because of a deficiency in foreman.
